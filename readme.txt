LDES is a mini example of a block cipher that has 2 rounds in the Feistel structure. It operates on 4-bit block and 2-bit key. The important feature of LDES is that the S-box has been replaced with a linear operation, which makes the whole cipher linear. The purpose of this exercise is to help you understand the importance of S-box in DES. Without the S-box, the cipher becomes linear and can be totally broken. This exercise will guide you step-by-step to break the linear cipher LDES.
